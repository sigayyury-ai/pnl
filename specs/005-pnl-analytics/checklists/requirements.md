# Specification Quality Checklist: PNL Analytics and Calculations

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (profit/loss, balance comparison, profitability ratio calculation)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Financial calculations properly defined with precision requirements

## Notes

- Specification covers complete PNL analytics functionality with automatic calculations
- Clear integration with existing PNL table and category management features
- Success criteria focus on financial accuracy, user experience, and system reliability
- Edge cases properly address mathematical edge cases (division by zero, missing data)
- Profitability ratio formula explicitly defined for implementation clarity
