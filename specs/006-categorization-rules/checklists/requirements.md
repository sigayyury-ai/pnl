# Specification Quality Checklist: Categorization Rules Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (automatic rule creation, rule application, manual management)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Rule pattern matching and conflict resolution properly addressed

## Notes

- Specification covers complete categorization rules lifecycle from automatic creation to manual management
- Clear integration with CSV processing workflow ensures rules are created from user corrections and applied during future uploads
- Success criteria focus on automation efficiency, user experience, and system consistency
- Edge cases address rule conflicts, pattern matching complexities, and data integrity scenarios
- Hard-coded rule system provides predictable categorization behavior distinct from AI-based categorization
