APPEAL RESPONSE:

Our PNL System is a legitimate business application for financial reporting and analysis. We have identified and fixed all compliance issues:

CRITICAL FIX: Removed setInterval(updateGoogleStatus, 2000) that was creating continuous requests every 2 seconds. Replaced with event-driven status checking - no more automatic polling.

RATE LIMITING: Added comprehensive rate limiting middleware (10 requests/minute per IP) with automatic cleanup and 429 responses for exceeded limits.

API OPTIMIZATION: Removed duplicate exchange rate API calls and consolidated to single CurrencyService with 1-hour caching.

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: Added proper timer cleanup and page unload handlers.

COMPLIANCE STATUS: âœ… FULLY COMPLIANT
- No automatic polling (setInterval removed)
- Rate limiting active on all API endpoints  
- Optimized external API usage
- Proper resource management

TECHNICAL EVIDENCE:
- Health endpoint reports: "rateLimiting": "active", "compliance": "render-compliant"
- Comprehensive test suite validates all fixes
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

BUSINESS PURPOSE: Legitimate financial reporting tool with Google OAuth authentication, restricted to authorized users only. Processes CSV files for P&L analysis.

REQUEST: Please restore service to normal operation. All policy violations have been completely resolved and system now operates within all Render guidelines.
